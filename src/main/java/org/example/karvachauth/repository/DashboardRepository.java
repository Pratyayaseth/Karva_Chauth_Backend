/**
 * All dashboard native queries. Anchored to Lead only so Spring Data recognises
 * this as a JPA repository; every method here is a native query.
 *
 * Common parameters:
 *   path -> 'WIFE' / 'HUSBAND' / 'SPARKLE' (TEMPLATE_* constants), or NULL for all paths
 *   from -> inclusive start of the window
 *   to   -> exclusive end of the window (start of the day after the last day)
 *
 * Two kinds of window:
 *   - EVENT queries (metric cards, outcomes, activity) count things that HAPPENED in the window.
 *   - FUNNEL queries (bot flow drop-off) follow the sessions that STARTED in the window
 *     (sessions.started_at), so every stage is a subset of "Opener" and never goes above 100%.
 *
 * How the bot records data (BotEngineServiceImple):
 *   - The Step 0 template's first delivery receipt creates a session on OPENER with NO path.
 *     When she taps a Step 0 button the path is set — so "path IS NOT NULL" = she tapped Step 0.
 *     (If she was mid-journey, the tap closes that session and starts a new one with the path.)
 *   - Every message is saved on the step it puts her on: a tap that IS a step ("Choose my gift",
 *     a category) moves the session first, and moveTo() re-saves our reply on the new step. So
 *     "reached step X" = any message (in or out) saved with step X.
 *   - The Step 0 template message itself has no path, so it only counts under "all paths".
 *
 * The funnel follows sessions by started_at — for a session made by the template receipt, that is
 * when the template reached her (the tap can come later).
